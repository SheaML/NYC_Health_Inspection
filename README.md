# Combining restaurant health inspection and Foursquare data to help consumers and restaurants


This jupyter notebook presents some preliminary analysis of restaurant health inspection data for NYC. This data, collected by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) is available from https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j. I completed this work as part of my capstone project for IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.
One major goal of this notebook was to link the health inspection data with Foursquare data on location and user rating, as we needed to make use of the Foursquare API for the course. My solution for this is admittedly very quick-and-dirty.
This is my first time working in Python, and another major goal of this work for me was simply to get more comfortable working with common Python libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib).
I've tried to look at the data from the perspective of the consumers (Foursquare users), the restaurants, and the DOHMH, creating products that could benefit each potential stakeholder.
